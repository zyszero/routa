# Routa.js Architecture Guide

## Project Overview

**Routa.js** is a multi-agent coordination platform with a **dual-backend architecture**:
- **Next.js Backend** (TypeScript) — Web deployment on Vercel with Postgres/SQLite
- **Rust Backend** (Axum) — Desktop application with embedded server and SQLite
- `crates/routa-server` — the same logic of Next.js backend, but implemented in Rust

Both backends implement **identical REST APIs** for seamless frontend compatibility.

## Documentation

- Unless I ask to write docs, you don't need to write docs for your work.

## Testing

- Use playwright tool (mcp) to test the web UI by youself if possible
- Use playwright testing e2e
- Test Tauri UI with `npm run tauri dev`, then use playwright to test the UI (http://127.0.0.1:3210/) too.

## Pull Request

- When plan to create a PR, should  attach screenshot with Playwright in GitHub PR body 

## Issue Management

- When create GitHub issues, should use `gh issue create` and add `--label "Agent"`, your name in body. 
- Building an agent is complex, and API or web interactions may fail unexpectedly.  
Log issues in `issues/` as structured Markdown files (with YAML front-matter) to document **WHAT happened** and **WHY it might happen** — not how to fix it.  
These files serve as context handoff between agents and humans.
- Local issues live in `issues/` as Markdown files with YAML front-matter. They serve as
context handoff between agents (and humans) — focus on **WHAT** and **WHY**, not HOW to resolve.
- File Naming: `issues/YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md`

## Debug

- When debug developing frontend Bug, you can use console.log to log in browser, use Playwright read and reslove it.
- After resolve bug, should clear unused console.log

## Testing 

- 当遇到改动文件多的场景，请使用浏览器（playwright/MCP Tool），从头到尾执行一次看看
  - 首页选 claude code，输入个需求，会自动跳转到详细页，并触发 ACP 会话，根据你的场景，你可以问这个 AI Chatbot 一些问题
  - 访问一个 workspace 详情页，点击会话，切换 Trace UI 看是否有历史
  - 你也可以在浏览器里，打开开发者工具，查看网络请求，看看是否符合预期

## Commit

- Follow the Baby-Step Commit principle — keep commits small, but not excessively granular.
- Always include the related GitHub issue ID when applicable.
- Make sure tests pass before pushing.
- Append a co-author line in the following format: (YourName, like Copilot,Augment,Claude etc.) (Your model name) <YourEmail, like, <claude@anthropic.com>, <auggie@augmentcode.com>)
  for example:
  ```
