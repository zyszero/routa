# Routa.js — Multi-agent coordination platform with dual-backend architecture (Next.js + Rust/Axum).

Routa.js is a workspace-first multi-agent coordination platform with two runtime surfaces:

- Web: Next.js app and API in `src/`
- Desktop: Tauri app in `apps/desktop/` backed by Axum in `crates/routa-server/`

The project is intentionally not "two separate products". Web and desktop differ in deployment model and storage, but they are expected to preserve the same domain semantics, API shape, and agent-coordination behavior.

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Canonical architecture boundaries, domain model, protocol stack, and cross-backend invariants.
- `docs/adr/`: Durable architectural decisions. Start here for "why".
- `docs/design-docs/`: Human-reviewed design intent and normalized decisions migrated from `.kiro/specs/`.

## Coding Standards

- General coding style guidance lives in `docs/coding-style.md`; keep this file focused on routing and repo-level guardrails.
- Source of truth for executable gates is `docs/fitness/` + `entrix`; do not restate tool-level checks here.
- Frontend and desktop API calls in `src/app` and `src/client` should use `resolveApiPath` + `desktopAwareFetch` for统一的后端路径组装：
  - `resolveApiPath`（`src/client/config/backend.ts`）：统一补全 `/api` 前缀并在需要时拼接后端 base URL。
  - `desktopAwareFetch`（`src/client/utils/diagnostics.ts`）：在 Tauri 桌面静态运行时自动落到 `http://127.0.0.1:3210` 或配置的后端地址。
  - 避免在前端/桌面再次直接写 `fetch('/api/...')`。
- For long behavior-heavy files, prefer **orchestration shell + domain hooks** over UI-only slicing.
- Apply the same pattern to oversized API routes: thin top-level route, extract workflow branches (session creation, streaming, provider dispatch, etc.).
- Split route refactors by workflow branch before shared helpers; avoid premature generic `utils`.
- Before large behavior refactors, add or extend characterization tests that lock routing/lifecycle/persistence/recovery behavior.
- All UI-facing strings must go through the i18n system (e.g., `t('key')`). Do not hardcode English or Chinese literals in components.

## Testing and Debugging

- Use `agent-browser` (or Electron/browser skills) for manual walkthroughs and visual evidence capture.
- Use Playwright e2e for automated UI coverage.
- Tauri UI smoke path: `npm run tauri dev`, then validate via `http://127.0.0.1:3210/`.
- If Tauri routes look wrong, verify fallback mapping in `crates/routa-server/src/lib.rs` and placeholders in `out/workspace/__placeholder__/`.
- For large or cross-core changes, run graph probes first: `entrix graph impact`, `entrix graph test-radius`, or `entrix graph review-context`.
- Temporary frontend debug `console.log` is allowed during diagnosis; remove all debug logs before finish.

## Validation

Before PR, run `entrix` using `docs/fitness/README.md` as canonical rulebook.

```bash
entrix run --dry-run
entrix run --tier fast
entrix run --tier normal   # when behavior/shared modules/APIs/workflow orchestration changed
```

- If a check fails, fix and re-run; do not skip.
- Skip source-code validation only when changes are strictly non-code (`*.md`, `*.yml`, `*.yaml`, `.github/`, `docs/`, etc.).
- Build if needed: `cargo build -p entrix`.

## Git Discipline

### Baby-Step Commits (Enforced)

- One commit = one concern (feature, fix, or refactor) with Conventional Commits format.
- No kitchen-sink commits; split mixed concerns.
- Target budget: under 10 files and under 1000 changed lines per commit.
- Include related GitHub issue ID when applicable.

### Co-Author Format

- If closing an issue in commit text, verify against `main` first: `gh issue view <issue-id>`.
- Always add co-author information.
- Only ONE co-author line is allowed. If multiple agents contributed, aggregate into ONE entry

Format example:

Co-authored-by: <AgentName> (<Model>) <Email>

Valid examples (choose EXACTLY ONE):

Co-authored-by: Kiro AI (Claude Opus 4.6) <kiro@kiro.dev>
Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot Agent (GPT 5.4) <198982749+copilot@users.noreply.github.com>

## Pull Request

- For UI-affecting changes, include browser screenshots or recordings in PR body (prefer `agent-browser` captures).
- Attach e2e screenshots/recordings when available.

## Issue Feedback Loop

- Before creating a new issue, search `docs/issues/` for existing incident context.
- For non-trivial failures, create/update `docs/issues/YYYY-MM-DD-short-description.md` first (focus on WHAT/WHY), then escalate to GitHub.
- Use one canonical active local tracker per problem. If you need supporting material, record it as a non-issue note via `kind: analysis`, `kind: progress_note`, or `kind: verification_report` instead of opening another active tracker for the same problem.
- Use `kind: github_mirror` only for GitHub-synced mirror files. Those mirrors are reference material, not canonical active local trackers.
- If a local record tracks a GitHub issue, populate `github_issue`, `github_state`, and `github_url` so issue review can detect status drift automatically.
- When resolved, update the local issue record and close the GitHub issue.
- Run issue hygiene/garbage collection at least once every 7 days. Track the last sweep time in `docs/issues/issue-gc-state.yaml` (`last_reviewed_at`).
- If `last_reviewed_at` is 7+ days old when an agent reads this contract, the agent should invoke `AskUserQuestion` first: whether to run issue sync/cleanup now.
- After finishing an issue GC pass, update `docs/issues/issue-gc-state.yaml` with the new `last_reviewed_at`.

## Reading Order

When starting work on this repository, read in this order:

1. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — runtime topology and boundaries.
2. `docs/adr/README.md` — decision index, then relevant ADRs.
3. `docs/fitness/README.md` — quality gates and verification flow.
4. Task-specific files in `docs/design-docs/` or `docs/exec-plans/`.
