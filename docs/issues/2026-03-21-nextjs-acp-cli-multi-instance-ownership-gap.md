# Next.js ACP CLI sessions are bound to a single web instance

## What Happened

ACP CLI sessions created from the Next.js runtime depend on process-local state for both execution and live updates. The spawned ACP process is stored in the in-memory `AcpProcessManager`, and the browser SSE stream is attached to the in-memory `HttpSessionStore`.

When a later request for the same session lands on a different Next.js instance, the second instance can load the session metadata from persistence but does not own the live CLI process or the original SSE controller state. This creates a split between durable session metadata and non-durable live execution state.

## Expected Behavior

ACP CLI sessions should remain routable and observable regardless of which Next.js instance receives a later request. Session ownership should be explicit and renewable, and live updates should not depend on a single web instance keeping process-local maps alive.

## Reproduction Context

- Environment: web
- Trigger: create an ACP CLI session on one Next.js instance, then send prompt or attach SSE from another instance

## Why This Might Happen

- Session execution is embedded inside the Next.js API runtime rather than isolated behind a dedicated execution service.
- Session metadata is persisted, but live process ownership and SSE delivery are tracked only in process-local memory.
- The current API contract does not persist explicit owner or lease metadata that would let later requests decide whether to proxy or reject work.

## Relevant Files

- `src/app/api/acp/route.ts`
- `src/core/acp/acp-process-manager.ts`
- `src/core/acp/http-session-store.ts`
- `src/core/acp/session-db-persister.ts`
- `src/core/db/schema.ts`
- `src/core/db/sqlite-schema.ts`

## Observations

- `getAcpProcessManager()` and `getHttpSessionStore()` both use `globalThis`, which survives HMR but remains process-local.
- Serverless-specific adapter recreation exists for SDK providers, but the generic CLI process path still assumes local ownership.
- Session metadata can survive restart, but live CLI routing cannot.

## References

- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Progress

- Session ownership metadata is now actively enforced in the Next.js ACP route instead of being passive persistence only.
- `src/app/api/acp/route.ts` now rejects SSE attach and prompt-style ACP JSON-RPC requests when an `embedded` session is still leased to a different `ownerInstanceId`.
- `src/core/acp/execution-backend.ts` now exposes reusable lease/ownership helpers so embedded session routing can make explicit decisions from persisted metadata.
- Added ACP route regression coverage for foreign-owner rejection in `src/app/api/acp/__tests__/route.test.ts`.

## Remaining Gap

- This closes the silent split-brain failure mode by turning wrong-instance access into an explicit protocol error.
- It does **not** yet provide full cross-instance continuation or proxying for embedded CLI sessions; a later phase still needs either:
  - a dedicated execution service / runner for CLI-backed ACP sessions, or
  - explicit owner handoff / lease takeover with resumable live process semantics.

## Verification

- `npx vitest run src/app/api/acp/__tests__/route.test.ts src/core/acp/__tests__/execution-backend.test.ts`
- `entrix run --tier normal` on 2026-03-28: overall `PASS` with final score `100.0%`
