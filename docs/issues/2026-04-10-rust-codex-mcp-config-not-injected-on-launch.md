# Rust desktop Codex sessions did not inject Routa MCP config at launch

## What Happened

Kanban Codex sessions created from the Rust desktop backend started successfully, but inside the Codex conversation the built-in Routa MCP tools were missing.

The session transcript showed Codex falling back to generic MCP discovery calls and then reporting that no board tools such as `create_card` were exposed.

## Expected Behavior

- Codex desktop sessions should always see the `routa-coordination` MCP server when Routa launches the provider for a workspace session.
- Kanban planning agents should be able to create backlog cards immediately instead of stalling on missing tool exposure.

## Why This Happened

- Rust desktop setup wrote Codex MCP configuration into project-scoped `.codex/config.toml`.
- The actual Codex launch path only injected one CLI override: project trust.
- That meant the launch depended on Codex discovering and loading the project config file correctly in this runtime path.
- In the failing Tauri/WebView flow, that assumption was not reliable enough, so Codex started without the `mcp_servers.routa-coordination` entry active.

This diverged from the stronger precedence model documented by Codex:

1. CLI flags and `--config` overrides
2. profile values
3. project config files
4. user config
5. system config
6. built-in defaults

## Resolution

The Rust desktop backend now keeps Codex MCP overlay data in a Routa-private file:

- `~/.routa/codex/config.toml`

Routa does not modify the user's global `~/.codex/config.toml`.

At launch time, Routa reads its private overlay file and expands it into Codex CLI config overrides:

- `projects."<cwd>".trust_level="trusted"`
- `mcp_servers.routa-coordination.url="..."`
- `mcp_servers.routa-coordination.enabled=true`

In addition, Routa now injects the same MCP server directly into `codex-acp` via ACP `session/new` / `session/load` `mcpServers` payloads, using the standard Streamable HTTP shape:

- `type: "http"`
- `name: "routa-coordination"`
- `url: "http://127.0.0.1:3210/api/mcp?..."`

This preserves Codex's highest-precedence `-c/--config` behavior without mutating the user's shared Codex configuration, while also avoiding reliance on Codex discovering config files later in the startup chain.
