# Routa Release Guide

This guide covers the process for releasing new Routa artifacts to multiple distribution channels: **crates.io** (Cargo), **npm**, and **GitHub Releases**.

## Overview

The release process publishes to three channels simultaneously:

1. **crates.io** - Rust users can `cargo install routa-cli` and `cargo install harness-monitor`
2. **npm** - Node.js users can `npm install -g routa-cli`
3. **GitHub Releases** - Desktop binaries and release notes

## Prerequisites

### Repository Secrets

Ensure these GitHub secrets are configured:

- `CRATE_TOKEN` - Get from [crates.io/me](https://crates.io/me) → API Tokens (Note: The workflow uses `CRATE_TOKEN`, not `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`)
- `NPM_TOKEN` - Get from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) → Access Tokens → Generate New Token → Automation
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

### Local Setup

```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch with latest code
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Verify no uncommitted changes
git status
```

## Release Methods

### Method 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

Use the release helper script:

```bash
# Interactive mode - prompts for version
./scripts/release/publish.sh

# Direct mode - specify version
./scripts/release/publish.sh 0.2.5

# Dry run - test without publishing
./scripts/release/publish.sh 0.2.5 --dry-run
```

The script will:
1. Sync version across all packages
2. Generate a release notes preview under `dist/release/release-notes.md`
3. Show you the changes
4. Create commit and tag
5. Push to trigger GitHub Actions

### Generate Release Notes

Tauri draft releases use commit-derived release notes. Generate the same markdown locally before publishing:

```bash
npm run release:changelog -- \
  --from v0.2.5 \
  --to v0.2.6 \
  --out dist/release/release-notes.md \
  --changelog-out dist/release/CHANGELOG.generated.md
```

For the hybrid workflow, generate the AI prompt package, ask the bundled specialist for a curated `summaryMarkdown`, then re-run the changelog with that curated summary:

```bash
# deterministic technical changelog + prompt package
npm run release:changelog -- \
  --from v0.2.5 \
  --to v0.2.6 \
  --prompt-out dist/release/changelog-summary-prompt.json \
  --changelog-out dist/release/CHANGELOG.generated.md \
  --out dist/release/release-notes.md

# optional one-step specialist run; requires a configured ACP provider
npm run release:changelog -- \
  --from v0.2.5 \
  --to v0.2.6 \
  --ai \
  --ai-provider claude \
  --out dist/release/release-notes.md \
  --changelog-out dist/release/CHANGELOG.generated.md
```

The generated release notes contain a user-facing `Summary`, a technical changelog, commit links, install instructions, and range metadata. `--changelog-out` writes the same tag range as a standalone `# Changelog` entry. If you want manual curation without running a specialist, write the curated summary in Markdown and pass it with `--summary-file`.

### Method 2: Manual Process

```bash
# 1. Update version in all packages
node scripts/release/sync-release-version.mjs --version 0.2.5

# 2. Review changes
git diff

# 3. Commit and tag
git commit -am "chore: release v0.2.5"
git tag v0.2.5

# 4. Push
git push origin main --tags
```

### Method 3: GitHub UI Dispatch

Manually trigger from GitHub:

1. Go to [Actions](https://github.com/phodal/routa/actions/workflows/release.yml)
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Enter version (e.g., `0.2.5` or `v0.2.5`)
4. Configure publish options:
   - `publish_cargo`: Publish to crates.io
   - `publish_cli`: Publish npm packages
   - `publish_desktop`: Create GitHub Release with desktop binaries
   - `dry_run`: Test without publishing

## Release Workflow

Once you push a tag (e.g., `v0.2.5`), GitHub Actions automatically:

### 1. Cargo Publish (`.github/workflows/cargo-release.yml`)

Publishes these crates in order:
1. `routa-core` - Core domain logic
2. `routa-rpc` - RPC layer
3. `routa-scanner` - Repository scanner
4. `routa-server` - HTTP server
5. `entrix` - Entrix fitness engine shared by Harness Monitor
6. `routa-cli` - CLI binary
7. `harness-monitor` - terminal watch and attribution tool

**Note**: Each crate waits for the previous one to be indexed on crates.io before publishing.

### 2. CLI Release (`.github/workflows/cli-release.yml`)

Builds platform-specific binaries:
- `linux-x64` - Linux x86_64
- `darwin-x64` - macOS Intel
- `darwin-arm64` - macOS Apple Silicon
- `win32-x64` - Windows x64

Then publishes to npm as:
- `routa-cli` - Main package with platform detection
- `routa-cli-linux-x64` - Linux binary
- `routa-cli-darwin-x64` - macOS Intel binary
- `routa-cli-darwin-arm64` - macOS ARM binary
- `routa-cli-windows-x64` - Windows binary

### 3. Desktop Release (`.github/workflows/tauri-release.yml`)

Creates GitHub Release with:
- Tauri desktop app installers for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Auto-generated release notes from `scripts/release/generate-changelog.mjs`
- CLI install instructions
- Automatic code signing for macOS (if configured)

**Platform Matrix**:
- `macos-latest` - Builds `.dmg` and `.app` for both Intel and Apple Silicon
- `ubuntu-22.04` - Builds `.deb` and `.AppImage` for Linux
- `windows-latest` - Builds `.msi` and `.exe` for Windows

**Important**: Desktop release requires all version fields to be synchronized:
- `apps/desktop/package.json`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

If Tauri fails with `version must be a semver string`, check that all three files have matching versions.

## Verification

After the release completes (~15-30 minutes), verify:

### Crates.io
```bash
cargo search routa-cli
cargo install routa-cli@0.2.5
routa --version

cargo search harness-monitor
cargo install harness-monitor@0.2.5
harness-monitor --version
```

### NPM
```bash
npm view routa-cli versions
npm install -g routa-cli@0.2.5
routa --version
```

### GitHub Release
Check [Releases page](https://github.com/phodal/routa/releases) for the new version.

## Troubleshooting

### Version Already Published on crates.io

If a crate version already exists on crates.io, the workflow will skip it and continue. This is normal for patch re-releases.

### NPM Publish Fails

Check that `NPM_TOKEN` is valid:
- Token must have "Automation" access
- Token must not be expired
- You must be a maintainer of the `routa-cli` npm organization

**Known Issue**: The main `routa-cli` package may not be published even when platform packages succeed. If this happens:

1. Manually update `packages/routa-cli/package.json` optionalDependencies to the new version
2. Publish manually:
   ```bash
   cd packages/routa-cli
   npm publish --access public
   ```

**Root Cause**: The `stage-routa-cli-npm.mjs` script was missing main package staging logic (fixed in v0.2.9+).

### Cargo Publish Fails

Common issues:
- **Missing dependency version**: Ensure all workspace crates use the same version
- **API token expired**: Regenerate token at [crates.io/settings/tokens](https://crates.io/settings/tokens)
- **Network timeout**: Re-run the workflow
- **Wrong secret name**: The workflow expects `CRATE_TOKEN`, not `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`

**Known Issue**: Cargo crates may not be published automatically. If this happens:

1. Manually update all release crate versions:
   ```bash
   for crate in crates/routa-core crates/routa-rpc crates/routa-scanner crates/routa-server crates/entrix crates/routa-cli crates/harness-monitor; do
     sed -i '' 's/version = "OLD_VERSION"/version = "NEW_VERSION"/g' "$crate/Cargo.toml"
   done
   ```

2. Publish in dependency order:
   ```bash
   cargo login YOUR_CRATE_TOKEN
   cd crates/routa-core && cargo publish --no-verify
   cd ../routa-rpc && cargo publish --no-verify
   cd ../routa-scanner && cargo publish --no-verify
   cd ../routa-server && cargo publish --no-verify
   cd ../entrix && cargo publish --no-verify
   cd ../routa-cli && cargo publish --no-verify
   cd ../harness-monitor && cargo publish --no-verify
   ```

**Root Cause**: The `sync-release-version.mjs` script doesn't sync Rust crate versions (only Desktop Tauri and npm packages).

## Version Bump Types

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **Patch** (0.2.4 → 0.2.5): Bug fixes, no breaking changes
- **Minor** (0.2.5 → 0.3.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Major** (0.3.0 → 1.0.0): Breaking changes

## Rollback

If you need to rollback a release:

```bash
# Delete the tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v0.2.5
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.2.5
```

**Note**: You cannot unpublish from crates.io, but you can yank a version:

```bash
cargo yank routa-cli@0.2.5
```

## Known Issues & Gotchas

### 1. Main Release Workflow Doesn't Trigger Cargo Publish

**Issue**: `.github/workflows/release.yml` doesn't call `cargo-release.yml`, so Rust crates won't be published automatically.

**Workaround**: Manually trigger the Cargo release workflow or publish locally as described in "Troubleshooting > Cargo Publish Fails".

**Permanent Fix**: Add Cargo release job to main release workflow.

### 2. Version Sync Script Incomplete

**Issue**: `scripts/release/sync-release-version.mjs` only syncs:
- Desktop: `apps/desktop/package.json`, `apps/desktop/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
- CLI npm: `packages/routa-cli/package.json`

It does **not** sync:
- Rust crates: `crates/*/Cargo.toml`
- CLI npm optionalDependencies versions

**Workaround**: Manually update Rust crate versions and npm optionalDependencies as described in "Troubleshooting".

**Permanent Fix**: Extend `sync-release-version.mjs` to handle all version fields.

### 3. CLI Artifact Naming Convention

**Issue**: Build jobs must use consistent artifact names (without version strings) so the staging job can find them.

**Fixed in**: v0.2.9 - artifact names standardized to `routa-cli-{platform}` format.

### 4. Windows PowerShell vs Bash

**Issue**: Windows runners default to PowerShell, which doesn't handle `${RELEASE_VERSION}` environment variables the same way as bash, causing version parsing errors.

**Fixed in**: v0.2.9 - all version sync steps now explicitly use `shell: bash`.

### 5. macOS Bash 3 Compatibility

**Issue**: macOS runners use Bash 3.x which doesn't support `mapfile` command.

**Fixed in**: v0.2.9 - replaced `mapfile` with `while read` loops.
