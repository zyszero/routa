# Routa.js Architecture

Routa.js is a workspace-first multi-agent coordination platform with two runtime surfaces:

- Web: Next.js app and API in [`src/`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/src)
- Desktop: Tauri app in [`apps/desktop/`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/apps/desktop) backed by Axum in [`crates/routa-server/`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/crates/routa-server)

The project is intentionally not "two separate products". Web and desktop differ in deployment model and storage, but they are expected to preserve the same domain semantics, API shape, and agent-coordination behavior.

## Core Principles

- Workspace-first: workspaces are the top-level coordination boundary for sessions, tasks, notes, boards, codebases, worktrees, and memories.
- Dual-backend parity: Next.js and Rust expose the same product concepts and should stay aligned with [`api-contract.yaml`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/api-contract.yaml).
- Protocol-oriented orchestration: REST, MCP, ACP, A2A, AG-UI, and SSE are all first-class integration surfaces.
- Local-first execution: desktop mode favors SQLite, local agent binaries, local worktrees, and trace files.
- Provider abstraction: different agent CLIs and runtimes are normalized behind adapter layers instead of leaking provider-specific protocol details through the system.

## Runtime Topology

### Web Runtime

- Next.js serves pages under [`src/app/`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/src/app).
- API handlers in [`src/app/api/`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/src/app/api) use the TypeScript `RoutaSystem` from [`src/core/routa-system.ts`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/src/core/routa-system.ts).
- `RoutaSystem` selects storage by environment:
  - `DATABASE_URL` -> Postgres-backed stores
  - `ROUTA_DB_DRIVER=sqlite` or local Node runtime -> SQLite-backed stores
  - fallback -> in-memory stores
- Real-time updates are delivered mainly through SSE endpoints and in-process event broadcasting.

### Desktop Runtime

- Tauri hosts the UI and starts the embedded Axum server from [`crates/routa-server/src/lib.rs`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/crates/routa-server/src/lib.rs).
- Shared application state is built in [`crates/routa-core/src/state.rs`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/crates/routa-core/src/state.rs).
- The Rust backend owns local SQLite persistence, ACP runtime management, Docker-assisted agent execution, sandbox management, and local file/worktree operations.
- Tauri static export placeholders are a routing implementation detail, not part of the domain model.

## Shared Architecture Model

Both runtimes follow the same layered shape even though the concrete implementation differs:

```text
Presentation
  React pages, workspace views, session detail, kanban, settings, traces

API / Transport
  Next.js route handlers or Axum routers

Protocol Adapters
  REST, MCP, ACP, A2A, AG-UI, SSE, JSON-RPC normalization

Domain Services
  orchestration, kanban automation, workflow execution, notes, review, scheduling

Stores / Registries
  workspace, task, session, note, codebase, worktree, schedule, artifact, skill

Persistence / Runtime
  Postgres, SQLite, in-memory, JSONL traces, local processes, Docker, filesystem
```

Dependency direction should stay downward. UI and transport layers depend on domain services; stores and runtime layers should not depend on UI concerns.

## Primary Domain Boundaries

### Workspace

Workspace is the primary user-visible scope. Users navigate by workspace first and then inspect sessions, boards, notes, tasks, codebases, or memories within that scope.

Current canonical background:
- [workspace-centric-redesign.md](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/docs/design-docs/workspace-centric-redesign.md)

Important invariant:
- New product surfaces should require explicit workspace context unless they are deliberate bootstrap flows.

### Codebase And Worktree

- A workspace can own multiple codebases.
- A codebase models repo identity and metadata such as path, branch, label, and default status.
- Worktrees are ephemeral or semi-persistent execution copies tied to a workspace and codebase.
- File search, sandbox resolution, and repo selection should flow through codebase/worktree context instead of hidden global repo state.

### Session

- A session represents a live or historical agent execution thread.
- Sessions are workspace-scoped and power the session detail page, trace views, and automation status.
- Session history may live in database rows and/or JSONL traces depending on runtime.
- ACP is the primary execution transport for agent CLIs, but some providers require adapter translation.

### Task And Kanban

- Tasks are the durable work units.
- Kanban is not just a UI projection; it also drives lane-based automation and queueing.
- Column transitions can trigger fresh ACP sessions and enrich tasks with provider/role/session metadata.
- The TypeScript queue in [`src/core/kanban/kanban-session-queue.ts`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/src/core/kanban/kanban-session-queue.ts) enforces per-board concurrency and prevents stale auto-run entries from re-firing incorrectly.

### Background Task And Workflow

- Background tasks model durable async work such as scheduled runs, polling-triggered actions, or workflow fan-out.
- Workflows convert a higher-level automation definition into multiple background tasks with dependency ordering.
- Schedule ticks, webhook events, and polling adapters can all enqueue background tasks instead of invoking execution inline.

### Note, Memory, Artifact

- Notes support collaborative knowledge capture and use CRDT-based real-time behavior on the TypeScript side.
- Memory endpoints store workspace-scoped contextual records.
- Artifacts are structured outputs exchanged between agents, workflows, or coordination tools.

## System Factories And Shared State

### TypeScript `RoutaSystem`

[`src/core/routa-system.ts`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/src/core/routa-system.ts) is the central assembly point for the Next.js runtime. It wires:

- stores for agents, conversations, tasks, notes, workspaces, codebases, worktrees, schedules, kanban boards, background tasks, workflow runs, and artifacts
- `EventBus` for in-process coordination
- MCP-facing tool surfaces such as `AgentTools`, `NoteTools`, and `WorkspaceTools`
- note broadcasting and CRDT document management
- permission storage used by runtime permission delegation flows

This file is the TypeScript equivalent of a service container. New domain services should usually be introduced here rather than instantiated ad hoc inside route handlers.

### Rust `AppState`

[`crates/routa-core/src/state.rs`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/crates/routa-core/src/state.rs) plays the same role for the Axum server. It wires:

- core stores including workspace, codebase, worktree, task, note, kanban, conversation, artifact, schedule, and ACP session stores
- `AcpManager`, binary/runtime/warmup managers, and ACP path resolution
- `SkillRegistry`
- `EventBus`
- `SandboxManager`
- Docker detection and process management

This keeps desktop/server execution local-first while preserving the same domain vocabulary as the web runtime.

## Protocol Stack

| Protocol | Primary endpoints | Role |
|---|---|---|
| REST | `/api/*` | CRUD and product-facing operations |
| MCP | `/api/mcp`, `/api/mcp/tools` | tool execution and collaborative agent capabilities |
| ACP | `/api/acp` and related runtime/registry/docker routes | spawn, prompt, stream, install, warm up, and manage agent runtimes |
| A2A | `/api/a2a/*` | agent-to-agent interoperability |
| AG-UI | `/api/ag-ui` | UI-facing agent stream protocol |
| A2UI | `/api/a2ui/*` | dashboard-oriented UI protocol surfaces |
| SSE | ACP, notes, AG-UI, and related endpoints | incremental updates to the frontend |

The product surface changes often. For endpoint inventory, use [`docs/product-specs/FEATURE_TREE.md`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/docs/product-specs/FEATURE_TREE.md) rather than expanding this document into an API catalog.

## ACP And Provider Architecture

ACP is the main execution protocol for coding agents, but providers do not behave identically.

The normalization pattern is:

```text
Provider process or bridge
  -> provider-specific output / notifications
  -> adapter normalization
  -> unified session updates
  -> persistence, traces, and UI streaming
```

Current provider/runtime concerns include:

- standard ACP-compatible CLIs
- Claude Code style stream-json flows that must be translated into ACP-like updates
- Docker-backed OpenCode execution paths
- runtime installation, warmup, and registry discovery

The Rust ACP subsystem lives under [`crates/routa-core/src/acp/`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/crates/routa-core/src/acp), while the web runtime keeps corresponding process and route logic under [`src/core/acp/`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/src/core/acp) and [`src/app/api/acp/`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/src/app/api/acp).

## Real-Time And Eventing

There are two main real-time mechanisms:

- transport-level streaming: mainly SSE for session, note, and protocol updates
- in-process eventing: `EventBus` in both TypeScript and Rust runtimes

These support:

- agent lifecycle tracking
- kanban auto-run queue draining
- note change propagation
- workflow and background-task coordination
- UI refresh triggers for session and trace surfaces

## Persistence Model

### Web

- Primary persistent target is Postgres when `DATABASE_URL` is configured.
- SQLite is supported for local Node development.
- In-memory mode remains available for tests and lightweight runtime scenarios.

### Desktop

- SQLite is the normal persistent store.
- Filesystem state is also part of persistence: session JSONL traces, repos, worktrees, agent binaries, and local config.

### Traces And History

- Session and trace history may be stored in database records, JSONL files, or both depending on runtime.
- Trace data is a first-class debugging and attribution mechanism, not an incidental log stream.

## Rust API Surface

The Axum router in [`crates/routa-server/src/api/mod.rs`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/crates/routa-server/src/api/mod.rs) shows the breadth of the desktop/server backend. In addition to the core workspace/session/task APIs, it includes:

- ACP registry, runtime, and Docker routes
- Kanban and worktree routes
- MCP server management
- clone, files, and GitHub import/search helpers
- schedules, polling, webhooks, workflows, and background tasks
- sandbox and review endpoints

This breadth is intentional: the desktop backend is not a thin transport shim. It is a full local coordination runtime.

## Current Transitional Areas

The repository is still finishing the workspace-centric normalization. The durable status lives in [`docs/design-docs/workspace-centric-redesign.md`](/Users/phodal/ai/routa-js/docs/design-docs/workspace-centric-redesign.md), but the key architecture caveat is:

- some paths still fall back to `"default"` when workspace scope is omitted
- some bootstrap/runtime flows still assume a default workspace exists
- not every persistence-backed implementation is fully symmetric yet across TypeScript and Rust
- some workflow-run persistence remains in-memory even when other stores are persistent

Treat `"default"` as transition scaffolding, not as the target domain model.
